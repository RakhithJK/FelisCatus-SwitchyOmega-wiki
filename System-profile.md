The system profile is a predefined profile which explicitly uses the system proxy settings.

# Setting UI
This profile is predefined and not configurable. It is also hidden from the profile list to prevent confusion.

# Function
When this profile is applied, the system proxy settings come into effect.

# Inclusion in [[switch profile]]s
This profile cannot be configured as a [[result profile]].

# Design goal
The proxy settings should be cleared when this profile is applied, returning control to Other Extensions/Chromium/System.
