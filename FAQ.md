About the Project
-----------------

### What is SwitchyOmega?

SwitchyOmega is a proxy configuration tool. It allows easy management of multiple proxies and switching between them. Currently, it supports Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.

### Where can I get it?

You can try it on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif),
or grab a packaged extension file for offline installation on the [Releases page](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/releases).

### What's the relationship with SwitchySharp, SwitchyPlus and "Proxy Switchy!"?

SwitchyOmega can be considered the 2.x version of SwitchySharp. It provides all the features in SwitchySharp, SwitchyPlus and "Proxy Switchy!" and is compatible with the options of the old version.

Existing users are strongly advised to [update to SwitchyOmega](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/wiki/What's-new-in-SwitchyOmega#how-to-upgrade) for the newest fixes and features because the mentioned projects are not maintained any more. SwitchySharp users can automatically upgrade to SwitchyOmega by installing SwitchyOmega from the Chrome Web Store.

The old extensions are still available on Chrome Web Store because we do not want to force anyone to upgrade. Feel free to upgrade to SwitchyOmega if you need [the new features](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/wiki/What's-new-in-SwitchyOmega) at any time.

Proxies
-------

### This thing does not come with any free proxies!!!!!!!!1

Yup, that's right. You need your own proxy server for SwitchyOmega to work. SwitchyOmega is only meant to be a tool which you can use to configure your browser. We do not have free proxies for you to try it out because we are not a commercial company.

Nor does SwitchyOmega provide free VPNs or other network services. We do not have any charges or subscriptions. We do not provide support for any proxy server or proxy software. If you see any network provider that claims SwitchyOmega as their partner, please let us know. Because we do not have any partners right now.

### Will SwitchyOmega unblock XYZ, hide my IP address or do other wonderful tricks?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: SwitchyOmega will not magically unblock websites or protect your privacy, unless you instruct it to use a proxy server which does. You should only use trusted proxy servers, because SwitchyOmega can not protect you from bad proxies that inject ads, track you or record your password. And if you don't have a proxy server, you probably won't need SwitchyOmega. Sounds reasonable, right?

### I saw advertisements inserted to websites! OMG, what have you done?!

Please, calm down. SwitchyOmega never inserts any advertisements or makes any changes to any web pages. We have no reason to do that since we are not for profit.

Most of the time, it is the proxy server you are using who does that. Or sometimes, your ISP is the one to blame. SwitchyOmega has no way to prevent those changes.

If you still don't believe me, please take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega).
